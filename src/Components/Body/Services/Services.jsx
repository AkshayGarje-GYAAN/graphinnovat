    Which graphite should be used for certain applications? Should it be natural or synthetic? Which shape and particle size graphite should have to deliver the best performance? What should be the surface area of particles?
    
    Not all graphite is the same, there are different purities and flake sizes, all of which impacts the end users experience.
    
    We help you to find application-oriented graphite type, grade, properties, etc. and this is very necessary for any applications to get maximum desired performance and output. We hold qualified and experienced experts in matching graphite resource to high tech niche applications. Along with it, Graphinnovat does not give consultancy only based on experience but also owns state of art laboratory to prove the best optimal solution.
    
    Our state of art laboratory enables us to select application-centric exact grade of graphite, select best process for making dispersions, for specific applications. One of our expertise is make stable graphite dispersions.`,
